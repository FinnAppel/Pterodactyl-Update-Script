# Pterodactyl Update Script

This automated script allows you to update your Pterodactyl panel effortlessly in just a few seconds.

## How to Use
To update your Pterodactyl panel, simply run the following command:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FinnAppel/Pterodactyl-Update-Script/main/update.sh | sudo bash
```
_Note: On some systems, it's required to be already logged in as root before executing the one-line command (where `sudo` is in front of the command does not work)._

## Requirements
- `curl` must be installed on your system.
- Sufficient permissions to execute commands with `sudo`.

## Supported Linux (Unix) OS

| Linux Distro | Supported Versions | Support          |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ---------------- |
| Ubuntu       | 22.04, 24.04       | âœ… Supported |
| Debian       | None               | :x: Unsupported  |
| CentOS       | None               | :x: Unsupported  |

`If your Distro and/or Version is not listed, it is unsupported.`

## Notes
- It updates your Pterodactyl panel to the latest available version, ensuring your installation is up to date.
- If the panel encounters issues or breaks down, the script can also be used to reinstall it without deleting any server data, effectively restoring functionality.
